# Near Inbox

## What is Near Inbox?

An app for sending and receiving messages built on top of [Near](https://near.org) blockchain.

This app was built very quickly for learning purposes, and is not intended to be used in production.

## Features:

- The owner of the inbox can receive messages from other users.
- The messages are encrypted with the owner's public key.
- The messages can be decrypted with the owner's private key.
- The private key is loaded from the owner's NEAR credentials stored in the file system.
